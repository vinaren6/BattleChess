  title: Board Games 3D Pack
  sections:
  - heading: What is Board Games 3D Pack?
    text: We originally created Boargame 3D Pack to be only assets, high quality models
      and textures. We received a lot of demands to have a working coded example of
      the Chess mecanics. Sufficiantly enough, that decided to create an advanced
      package putting the assets to use in a real Chess game implementation.
